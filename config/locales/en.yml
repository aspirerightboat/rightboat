# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        As a new and used boat sales company, who pride ourselves on a first class service and image
        and also having an expert level of marketing for our clients, using a portal to list our boats
        is very important to get right. Fortunately, with RightBoat, our vessels details are nicely presented
        and not only that, presented to a wide audience. Further to that, their ‘Broker Area’ in the website
        very clearly displays all the analytics for all your vessels in an informative manner and has all the
        information you need, to study any one vessel’s performance in the market, which is especially helpful
        when putting this information back to our clients. Just recently, we had an enquiry come through on
        RightBoat for a vessel that was sitting quite stagnant in the market due to model undesirability and price,
        however just three days after the enquiry the vessel was sold. The pay-per-lead system which RightBoat
        offer is the way forward. Many thanks to Nicky and the team for the great service.
