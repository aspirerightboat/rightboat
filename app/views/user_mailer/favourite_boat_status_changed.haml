  Dear #{@user.name},

- case @reason
  - when 'deleted'
    %p Unfortunately the boat #{@boat.manufacturer_model} which you had in your favourites has now been sold.

    - if @similar_boats.count > 0
      %p However, there are other similar listings which may be of interest to you.
      %ul
        - @similar_boats.each do |boat|
          %li #{link_to boat.manufacturer_model, boat_url(boat)}

  - when 'price_changed'
    %p
      Your favourite boat #{link_to @boat.manufacturer_model, boat_url(@boat)} has changed price.
      New price is #{@boat.safe_currency.symbol}#{@boat.price}.

  Kind regards,
